# gwk-web

This repository contains the sources for https://gwk.github.io. The site is generated using <https://gwk.github.io/muck Muck>.

# How it works

Github has a feature called "Github Pages" that provides static site hosting for user and project sites. Because user sites are <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages served directly out of the master> branch (whereas project pages can be served out of the `docs/` subdirectory), the site is structured in two parts: this source repo, and a contents submodule repo called `gwk.github.io` and checked out as `site` which contains the generated content. The top-level makefile uses Muck to build the pages, then copies the built product into `site`.
